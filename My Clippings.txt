The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first. Don’t worry, for now, about how you’ll make money or a career off it. Forget about being an expert or a professional, and wear your amateurism (your heart, your love) on your sleeve. Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.

“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.” —Steve Jobs

levels of analysis the differing complementary views, from biological to psychological to social-cultural, for analyzing any given phenomenon. Consider horrific school shootings. Do they occur because the shooters have brain disorders or genetic tendencies that cause them to be violent? Because they observe brutality in the media or play violent video games? Because they live in a gun-toting society? The biopsychosocial approach enables psychologists to move beyond labels (“school shooter”) and to consider the interconnected factors that may lead to violent acts (Pryor, 2019) (FIGURE 1). Clinical psychologists use this approach to help people with mental disorders (Teachman et al., 2019). FIGURE 1 Biopsychosocial approach This integrated viewpoint incorporates various levels of analysis and offers a more complete picture of any given behavior or mental process. The chart shows influence of the behavior or mental process under three headings as follows- "Biological influences: Genetic predispositions (genetically influenced traits); genetic mutations (random errors in gene replication); natural selection of adaptive traits and behaviors passed down through generations; genes responding to the environment"; "Psychological influences- Learned fears and other learned expectations; emotional responses; cognitive processing and perceptual interpretations"; and "Social-cultural influences- Presence of others; cultural, societal, and family expectations; peer and other group influences; compelling models (such as in the media)". An image beside the chart shows a microscope, with three lenses labeled as "Biological, Psychological, and social-cultural", with platform labeled as "Behavior or mental process". Each level of analysis offers a perspective for looking at a behavior or mental process, yet each by itself is incomplete. Each perspective described in TABLE 1 asks different questions and has its limits, but together they complement one another. Consider, for example, how they shed light on anger: Someone working from a neuroscience perspective might study brain circuits that cause us to be red in the face and “hot under the collar.” Someone working from an evolutionary perspective might analyze how anger facilitated the survival of our ancestors’ genes. Someone working from a behavior genetics perspective might study how heredity and experience influence our individual differences in temperament. Someone working from a psychodynamic perspective might view an outburst as an outlet for unconscious hostility. Someone working from a behavioral perspective might attempt to determine what triggers aggressive acts. Someone working from a cognitive perspective might study how our interpretation of a situation affects our anger and how our anger affects our thinking. Someone working from a social-cultural perspective might explore how expressions of anger vary across cultural contexts.

Ask yourself When you signed up for this course, what did you know about different psychology specialties? Want to learn more? See Appendix B, Career Fields in Psychology, at the end of this book, and go to our online Pursuing a Psychology Career resource to learn about the many interesting options available to those with bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in psychology. To review and test your understanding of psychology’s perspectives and subfields, engage online with Concept Practice: Psychology’s Current Perspectives and Concept Practice: Psychology’s Subfields. Psychology also influences culture. Knowledge transforms us. Learning about the solar system and the germ theory of disease alters the way people think and act. Learning about psychology’s findings also changes people: They less often judge psychological disorders as moral failings, treatable by punishment and ostracism. They less often regard and treat women as men’s mental inferiors. They less often view and raise children as ignorant, willful beasts in need of taming. “In each case,” noted Morton Hunt (1990, p. 206), “knowledge has modified attitudes, and, through them, behavior.” Once aware of psychology’s well-researched ideas—about how body and mind connect, how a child’s mind grows, how we construct our perceptions, how we learn and remember, how people across the world are alike (and different)—your mind may never again be the same. “The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1803–1882 But bear in mind psychology’s limits. Don’t expect it to answer the ultimate questions, such as those posed by Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy (1904): “Why should I live? Why should I do anything? Is there in life any purpose which the inevitable death that awaits me does not undo and destroy?” Although many of life’s significant questions are beyond psychology, some very important ones are illuminated by even a first psychology course. Through painstaking research, psychologists have gained insights into brain and mind, dreams and memories, depression and joy. Even the unanswered questions can renew our sense of mystery about things we do not yet understand. Moreover, your study of psychology can help teach you how to ask and answer important questions—how to think critically as you evaluate competing ideas and claims. “I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me.” — Job 42:3 Psychology deepens our appreciation for how we humans perceive, think, feel, and act. By so doing, it can enrich our lives and enlarge our vision. Through this book we hope to help guide you toward that end.
