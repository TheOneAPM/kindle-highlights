As my financial condition deteriorated to critical levels, my mental defenses also began to break down. My house in Michigan went into foreclosure, I had to move into a smaller apartment in Chicago, and as I watched the lease company pick up my Porsche and drive it away – I eventually accepted the inevitability of doing what I believed was the ultimate act of failure – and filed for bankruptcy.

Eventually I could gauge the positive effects these new attitudes had on my ability to shift my perspective and flow with the markets. The less I cared about whether or not I was wrong, the clearer things became, making it much easier to move in and out of positions, cutting my losses short to make myself mentally available to take the next opportunity.

The following typical trading errors have a specific cause rooted in a limited type of thinking methodology that can be changed: Refusing to define a loss. Not liquidating a losing trade, even after you have acknowledged the trade's potential is greatly diminished. Getting locked into a specific opinion or belief about market direction. a. From a psychological perspective this is equivalent to trying to control the market with your expectation of what it will do: "I'm right, the market is wrong." Focusing on the price and monetary value of a trade, instead of the potential or probability for the market to move, based on its behavior and structure. Revenge-trading as if you were trying get back at the market for what it took away from you. Not reversing your position even when you clearly sense a change in market direction. Not following the rules of the trading system you use. Planning for a move or feeling one building, but then finding yourself immobilized to hit the bid or offer, click your mouse to put on the trade, and therefore denying yourself the opportunity to profit. Not acting on your instincts or intuition because you don’t know if what you are feeling is true or just wishing or hoping. Establishing a consistent pattern of trading success over a period of time, and then giving your winnings back to the market in one or two trades and starting the cycle over again; in other words the “boom & bust” cycle.

Learning the dynamics of goal achievement so you can stay positively focused on what you want, not what you fear. Learning how to recognize the skills you need to progress as a trader and then stay focused on the development of those skills instead of the money, which is merely a by-product of you developing those skills. Learning how to adapt yourself to respond to, and accept, fundamental changes in market conditions more readily and objectively. Identifying the amount of risk with which you are comfortable within your own "risk comfort level" (meaning, not another trader’s idea of what risk is) – and then learn how to expand that comfort level in a way that is consistent with your ability to sustain an objective perspective of market activity. Learning how to execute your trades immediately upon your perception of an opportunity. Learning how to let the market tell you how much is enough, instead of assessing the potential from your personal value system of how much is enough – for you based on wishing and hoping instead of true market information. Learning how to structure your beliefs to effectively manage your perception of market movement. Learning how to achieve and maintain a state of objectivity. Learning how to recognize "true" intuitive information, again, not wishing, hoping or dreaming, and then learning how to act on it consistently.

There are four basic components that make up a person's standard of performance or expectations for results. First is our basic concept of time; most people believe that it is limited, passing us by nonstop and will eventually run out. Second is our concept of effort – our supply of personal energy is not inexhaustible; it runs out, we tire, and we may even become ill if we don't rest properly. Third is our concept of expertise – the number of skills we have learned and our degree of proficiency in using these skills; it usually takes a great deal of time and energy to acquire expertise. And one of the primary ways we learn to value ourselves is based on our belief about how much work we do and the amount of time it takes to do it. Which brings us to the fourth component in the equation : reward. To determine the amount of reward we should receive, we will make an assessment about how hard or easy a job is by determining how much effort (personal energy) we will need to expend and to assess how long the job will take (using up our limited time), so we can then determine how much we should be compensated. It is like our own personal supply-and-demand formula for our time and energy.

First, it is essential for you to learn how to release yourself from all feelings of inadequacy, guilt, or shame, especially when it comes to your trading. Second, it is critical to your success as a trader, that you learn how to identify and repair the residual psychological harm caused by the emotionally painful experiences, because painful experiences have the potential to generate fear. Finally, you will be required to undo any inappropriate trading habits and learn the appropriate positive skills that will help you eventually to accumulate the wealth you desire from trading.

Closing down in the midst of pain is a denial of a man’s true nature. A superior man is free in feeling and action, even amidst great pain and hurt. If necessary, a man should live with a hurting heart rather than a closed one. He should learn to stay in the wound of pain and act with spontaneous skill and love even from that place.

It is honorable for a man to admit his fears, resistance, and edge of practice. It is simply true that each man has his limit, his capacity for growth, and his destiny. But it is dishonorable for him to lie to himself or others about his real place. He shouldn’t pretend he is more enlightened than he is—nor should he stop short of his actual edge. The more a man is playing his real edge, the more valuable he is as good company for other men, the more he can be trusted to be authentic and fully present. Where a man’s edge is located is less important than whether he is actually living his edge in truth, rather than being lazy or deluded.

Some men fear the feeling of fear and therefore don’t even approach their edge. They choose a job they know they can do well and easily, and don’t even approach the fullest giving of their gift. Their lives are relatively secure and comfortable, but dead. They lack the aliveness, the depth, and the inspirational energy that is the sign of a man living at his edge.

a woman suggests something that changes a man’s perspective, then he should make a new decision based on his new perspective. But he should never betray his own deepest knowledge and intuition in order to please his woman or “go along” with her. Both she and he will be weakened by such an action. They will grow to resent each other, and the crust of accumulated inauthenticity will burden their love, as well as their capacity for free action.

A man must be prepared to give 100 percent to his purpose, fulfill his karma or dissolve it, and then let go of that specific form of living. He must be capable of not knowing what to do with his life, entering a period of unknowingness and waiting for a vision or a new form of purpose to emerge. These cycles of strong specific action followed by periods of not knowing what the hell is going on are natural for a man who is shedding layers of karma in his relaxation into truth.

consciously keep yourself open and available to receiving a vision of what is next. It will come. When it comes, it usually won’t be a detailed vision. You will probably have a sense of what direction to move in, but the practical steps might not make themselves clear. When the impulse begins to arise, act on it. Don’t wait for the details.

If a man never discovers his deepest purpose, or if he permanently compromises it and uses his family as an excuse for doing so, then his core becomes weakened and he loses depth and presence. His woman loses trust and sexual polarity with him, even though he may be putting much energy into parenting their children and doing the housework. A man should, of course, be a full participant in caring for children and the household. But if he gives up his deepest purpose to do so, ultimately, everyone suffers.

Doing is simply the nature of your bodily life. If you want the body to continue, you must eat and breathe. You must work, care for your family, and brush your teeth. But these are just the mechanics of life on Earth. They never come to the absolute truth of your being.

A woman often seems to test her man’s capacity to remain unperturbed in his truth and purpose. She tests him to feel his freedom and depth of love, to know that he is trustable. Her tests may come in the form of complaining, challenging him, changing her mind, doubting him, distracting him, or even undermining his purpose in a subtle or not so subtle way. A man should never think his woman’s testing is going to end and his life will get easier. Rather, he should appreciate that she does these things to feel his strength, integrity, and openness. Her desire is for his deepest truth and love. As he grows, so will her testing.

why would you consciously go about the task of learning how to change yourself from the inside? I have three reasons for you. First, because you can decide to learn new skills or ways of expressing yourself that are more fulfilling than you currently are experiencing in any area in your life. Second, because you may have any number of beliefs acting as resistance in the acquisition of the new skills you are attempting to learn – thus making it very challenging for you to experience more fulfillment.

The third reason why you would want to learn to change from the inside, instead of forcing the environment to conform to your psychological makeup, relates strictly to trading. The markets are just too big for one person or even a group of individuals to prevail for long. That is, if you don't have the financial power to move prices in your direction, then you are going to have to learn how to flow with and constantly adapt to the outer market conditions created by millions of other traders as well as large hedge funds and international banks and brokerage firms. The choice is you can either adapt or continue to experience some very painful lessons. A quick hint: the intensity of your emotional discomfort and pain you experience as a trader is an excellent indication of how much you will have to change, to trade without fear and be consistently successful.

“Keeping your word” is a masculine trait, in men or women. A person with a feminine essence may not keep her word, yet it is not exactly “lying.” In the feminine reality, words and facts take a second place to emotions and the shifting moods of relationship. When she says, “I hate you,” or “I’ll never move to Texas,” or “I don’t want to go to the movies,” it is often more a reflection of a transient feeling-wave than a well-considered stance with respect to events and experience. On the other hand, the masculine means what it says. A man’s word is his honor. The feminine says what it feels. A woman’s word is her true expression in the moment.

Since we know that winning can be a function of analysis and we need winning trades to be consistent, wouldn't it then be completely logical to conclude that the better our analysis is, the more consistent our results will be? Logical – yes, but it’s not completely true. The problem with this conclusion is that it is only valid to the extent that we have psychologically developed as a complete trader.

These five disciplines are: 1. Vision 2. Planning 3. Process Control 4. Measurement 5. Time Use The 12 Week Year will help you apply these disciplines in a way that leverages your knowledge and skills, and fosters consistent action. Vision: A compelling vision creates a clear picture of the future. It is critical that your business vision aligns with and enables your personal vision. This alignment ensures a powerful emotional connection that promotes a sustained commitment, and continual action. Planning: An effective plan clarifies and focuses on the top-priority initiatives and actions needed to achieve the vision. A good plan is constructed in a manner that facilitates effective implementation. Process Control: Process control consists of a set of tools and events that align your daily actions with the critical actions in your plan. These tools and events ensure that more of your time is spent on strategic and money making activities. Measurement: Measurement drives the process. It is the anchor of reality. Effective measurement combines both lead and lag indicators that provide comprehensive feedback necessary for informed decision making. Time Use: Everything happens in the context of time. If you are not in control of your time, then you are not in control of your results. Using your time with clear intention is a must.

TOLERATING HER LEADS TO RESENTING HER A man gets resentful and frustrated with his woman when he is too afraid, weak, or unskilled to penetrate her moods and tests into love. He wishes she were easier to deal with. But it is not entirely her fault that she is bitchy and complaining. It is also a reflection of her lack of being penetrated by love. When a man resigns, and simply tolerates his woman’s self-destructive moods, it is a sign of his weakness. His attitude has become one of wanting to escape women and the world, rather than wanting to serve women and the world into love. A man shouldn’t tolerate bitchy and complaining moodiness in his woman, but he should serve her and love her with every ounce of his skill and perseverance. Then, if she cannot or will not open in love, he might decide to end his relationship with her, harboring no anger or resentment, because he knows he has done everything he could.

Simply maintain a steady rhythm and skim left to right across each sentence, from one blank space to the next, without stopping or trying to make sure you understand what is being said.

over-trading happens when: you have an opinion about market direction you ask other traders to confirm that opinion you think your trade is a “sure thing” you are addicted to the illusion that your next trade will be the big win and make all your financial problems disappear, and therefore you continue to trade even though the market is telling you the exact opposite of what you think is happening

The more I followed my rules the more I trusted myself. The more I trusted myself, the more I could focus my attention on subtle relationships in the market's behavior to learn new things about the market – helping me become a better trader. Eventually I could gauge the positive effects these new attitudes had on my ability to shift my perspective and flow with the markets. The less I cared about whether or not I was wrong, the clearer things became, making it much easier to move in and out of positions, cutting my losses short to make myself mentally available to take the next opportunity.

The following typical trading errors have a specific cause rooted in a limited type of thinking methodology that can be changed: Refusing to define a loss. Not liquidating a losing trade, even after you have acknowledged the trade's potential is greatly diminished. Getting locked into a specific opinion or belief about market direction. a. From a psychological perspective this is equivalent to trying to control the market with your expectation of what it will do: "I'm right, the market is wrong." Focusing on the price and monetary value of a trade, instead of the potential or probability for the market to move, based on its behavior and structure. Revenge-trading as if you were trying get back at the market for what it took away from you. Not reversing your position even when you clearly sense a change in market direction. Not following the rules of the trading system you use. Planning for a move or feeling one building, but then finding yourself immobilized to hit the bid or offer, click your mouse to put on the trade, and therefore denying yourself the opportunity to profit. Not acting on your instincts or intuition because you don’t know if what you are feeling is true or just wishing or hoping. Establishing a consistent pattern of trading success over a period of time, and then giving your winnings back to the market in one or two trades and starting the cycle over again; in other words the “boom & bust” cycle.

The more sophisticated you become as a trader, the more you will realize that trading is a completely mental game. It isn't you against the markets, it's just you.

Starting small and gradually working into other combinations is a real exercise in discipline that has a couple of important psychological benefits. First, you will be building a base of confidence as you learn that you can, in fact, accurately assess what will most likely happen next. It is much easier to gain this confidence if you don't overwhelm yourself with the market's seemingly infinite possibilities. Second, by passing up other opportunities that you are not an expert at yet, you will be releasing yourself from any compelling desire to trade.

Picture yourself approaching you. The person that is standing in front of you is a version of you that is fully embodied and fully empowered. You walk closer and you see the conviction in your eyes. You are grounded in your truth. You are guiding yourself for the first time in your life. No one is dictating your truth, your narrative, or your value. You can trust yourself now. You can sense how wise you have become. You even look different! Your posture, your stance, and the way you show up in this room takes your breath away. I’m not referring to beauty here; I’m referring to the energy you radiate now. Even the way you talk sounds different to you. There is passion in your voice. There is belief in your words. There is stability in your steps and you realize, as this version of you goes to place their hand on your shoulder, that you have become exactly who you’ve been waiting for in every partner you’ve ever wanted. You’ve become someone who loves themselves, deeply, without contingencies, caveats, or coercion.

1. Being assertive isn’t being an asshole. Assholes play with emotions and prod and provoke, while assertive and dominant men simply aren’t afraid to state their mind. 2. Tarzan usually leads. Take the lead in your relationship like society and your women probably expect and prefer. 3. No time machines allowed during arguments. Don’t bring up issues form the past and inject them into current arguments. 4. Men can be “crazy” too. You are entitled to your opinion and perspective, but realize that that doesn’t mean other people should share it or accommodate it. 5. Make it safe for her to be vulnerable. Create a space for your woman to share her insecurities with you and strive to turn them into things she is proud about. 6. Match up your styles of affection. Everyone has different love languages and it can be immensely helpful to discover which you are your woman are. 7. Compromise, don’t sacrifice. Let your woman keep his own priories and hobbies, because those are what drew you to her in the first place. 8. Why can’t you be more like Alison? Never compare your woman to another female that you both know, and especially never your ex. 9. Really, her favorite bands are a dealbreaker? Examine if the traits you emphasize really matter to you, or if you just think they matter and have unfounded expectations surrounding them. 10. Rationalization is usually a cover. If you find yourself constantly rationalizing and making excuses for your how you are treated by your woman, it’s time to examine what that says about the level of respect in your relationship. 11. Who loves you the most? You! A woman is like the sunroof of a car – great to have, but only a part of the overall package. 12. Inspire her, motivate her. Inspire and motivate your woman by first becoming someone inspiring and motivating yourself. 13. The only “The One” questions you’ll need. Does she challenge you, do you respect her, and are you potentially best friends? Everything else is a wash. 14. Day to day chemistry beats the rich yoga instructor. What truly matters in a relationship is explosive chemistry and communication. Everything else on your laundry list of desired traits is simple a “nice to have.” 15. “Maybe” is usually “I’m scared to actually say no.” Examine the ones you are saying no to a commitment, and discover that there may be underlying reasons behind it. 16. Relationship pants are meant for two. Don’t be a passive party and let your woman plan everything and dominate the interactions. She will get nothing out of the relationship. 17. Let her feminine qualities shine. Women have egos. Don’t belittle their traditionally feminine qualities, traits, and skills. 18. She already has one father. There is a thin line between protecting and taking care of her… and fathering and nagging. 19. Exes are like Seal Team 6. Do not mention exes except on a need to know basis, and control the spread of information whenever possible. 20. Why doesn’t she just “want sex more”? We men desire sexual openness and desire… too bad women have been taught to suppress their sexual urges since youth. 21. Absence makes the heart (and other things) grow fonder. Taking your own space on a day to day basis, and making her take her own, will make her respect and desire you more. 22. It’s okay to be selfish sometimes. Don’t let the relationship and your woman’s priorities take over yours, because then you will lose yourself. 23. A spark is easy, a fire is tough. Initial chemistry requires literally zero work, but stoking the relationship fire is all effort, all the time. 24. Fear the routine. Routine is the bane of many relationships, so step outside your comfort zones and allow you and your woman to see each other in different lights.

Traders speculating on price movement don’t have to pay anything in advance to put on a trade nor do they have to accept the risk of finding out if a trade is going to work; which can make it seem like the risk of having to pay never really existed if the trade turns out to be a winner. This is an illusion.

If you’re going to become a consistent winner, mistakes can’t exist in the kind of negatively charged context in which they are held by most people. You have to be able to monitor yourself to some degree, and that will be difficult to do if you have the potential to experience emotional pain if and when you find yourself in the process of making an error. If this potential exists, you have two choices: 1. You can work on acquiring a new set of positively charged beliefs about what it means to make a mistake, along with de-activating any negatively charged beliefs that would argue otherwise or cause you to think less of yourself for making a mistake. 2. If you find this first choice undesirable, you can compensate for the potential to make errors by the way you set up your trading regime. This means that if you’re going to trade and not monitor yourself, but at the same time you desire consistent results, then trading exclusively from the mechanical stage will resolve the dilemma.

How to Body Double When you want to start body doubling, there’s a simple model for how it works. Tell the other person what you plan to do for the session (“I’m going to work on a chapter outline in my book”) Set a timer for a defined chunk of time (usually 30–60 minutes) Work quietly for the allotted time Share what you did at the end of the session (“I finished the outline and started writing my first rough draft”)

It’s so easy to say yes to things when they sound like exciting opportunities. Since you don’t have that “not enough time!” alarm bell, however, this inclination gets you into trouble. Pick your battles wisely and don’t agree to everything. Give yourself more time to consider commitments. Consult your calendar, or a friend who knows you well, to make sure you aren’t putting too much on your plate. Instead of agreeing to every new opportunity or request that comes your way, here are a few things you can say instead: “I’d love to, but I need to check my schedule.”

Summary of Time Strategies Learn to say no gracefully: Avoid overcommitting by “guarding your yes” and not agreeing to every new opportunity. Create time-based goals rather than outcome-based ones: Use time-based goals, rather than outcome-based ones, so you can celebrate success even when you don’t completely finish a task in the time you have available. Make micro-commitments: Propel yourself into motion by making a micro-commitment—a fast and easy action to ensure progress. Use visual timers: Use visual timers to keep you on track as time passes and to generate urgency that will help get you (or keep you) motivated.

Keep a historical time log: Use a stopwatch or timer app to record your travel times to make better estimates in the future. Turn Waiting Mode into Thinking Mode: When stuck in Waiting Mode, write out your thoughts to help clarify your thinking and clear any worries. Do something fun: Alternatively, when you’re stuck in Waiting Mode, try to embrace doing something fun instead of just worrying and doing nothing at all. Make it obvious: Make important tasks obvious and visible so you don’t forget about them until the last minute. Set up reminders: Create reminders to help you keep track of important tasks.

Summary of Memory Strategies Get a (good) app: Using apps and tools with customizable notifications can help you manage your organization and stay on top of your tasks and responsibilities. Make it convenient: Make important information convenient, visible, and easily accessible so they are more likely to be remembered. Make it visual: Keep important reminders literally in your sights so you’re more likely to remember and act on them. Create an action anchor: Use action anchors, objects associated with an action you want to take, as environmental cues to complete a task.

Double-checking beats reworking: Double-check your assumptions about a project or task to ensure you fully understand the requirements and expectations. Make it permanent: Create a permanent record by writing things down so you can reference your notes in the future. Use drop zones and launch pads: Use launch pads placed in consistently used drop zones to store essential items and ensure you don’t forget to bring them with you. Count on it: To build a routine, name it and its associated number of tasks—then say both out loud to recall the required actions.

Summary of Emotion Strategies Create a smile file: Create a smile file of wins and accomplishments you can refer to, replacing your negative soundtrack with indisputable proof of your achievements. Expand your vocabulary of emotions: Expand your vocabulary of emotions to better understand the nuances of each emotion and improve how you respond to them. Use a mood journal: Using a journal or app to track and reflect on changes in your mood can help you better understand what’s happening in your life and foster emotional growth. Create some space: Creating space can help you gain a healthier perspective on a stressful situation. Remember the past relationship: When conflict arises with someone, take a step back. Compare your history with the person to see if your strong immediate reaction really makes sense. Find your reset: Find those experiences that recharge your self-worth. Write out your thoughts and feelings: Journaling can provide clarity and help you identify negative thought patterns by allowing you to observe your emotions from a more critical distance. Take care of your basic needs: Taking care of basic needs is crucial for your mental health and overall well-being. Buy yourself some time: Resist impulsive reactions by buying time, which will allow your hindsight and foresight to catch up and weigh in on your decision-making. Learn from past mistakes: Reflect on past situations to avoid making the same mistakes.

How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky): ↓ Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. ↓ Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. ↓ Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. ↓ You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. ↓ You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. ↓ Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people. ↓ The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet. ↓ Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. ↓ Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. ↓ Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. ↓ Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. ↓ Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. ↓ Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. ↓ Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. ↓ Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. ↓ When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. ↓ Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. ↓ Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. ↓ “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” —Archimedes ↓ Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). ↓ Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment. ↓ Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. ↓ Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. ↓ Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. ↓ An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. ↓ If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. ↓ Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. ↓ Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. ↓ There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. ↓ Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers. ↓ Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching. ↓ You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar. ↓ Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. ↓ Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. ↓ Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. ↓ There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you. ↓ Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. ↓ When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day. [11] Summary: Productize Yourself

name for myself—and literally changed an industry as a result. Let me be clear here: I do not think that I've created extraordinary levels of success, nor do I think I have tapped into my full potential. I am completely aware that there are many people who are many times more successful—at least financially—than me. Although I am not Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, or one of the founders of Facebook or Google, I have created multiple companies from scratch that have allowed me to have an overall enjoyable lifestyle. The reason why I didn't create extraordinary levels of financial success is because I violated the second part of the 10X Rule: the 10X way of thinking. That would be my only regret: failing to approach my life with the right mind-set. I would have actually set targets that were 10 times what I had dreamed of in the beginning. But, like you, I am working on it now—and I still have a few years to correct this. I mention the notion of creating “extraordinary levels” of success time and again throughout this book. Extraordinary by definition means anything outside the realm of what most normal people can and do achieve. And of course that definition would then depend on with whom or what class of success you are comparing yourself. Before you say, “I don't need extraordinary levels of success” or “success is not everything” or “I just want to be happy” or whatever else you may be mumbling to yourself at this very moment, understand something: in order to get to the next level of whatever you're doing, you must think and act in a wildly different way than you previously have been.

the basic series of mistakes people make when setting out to achieve goals: 1. Mistargeting by setting objectives that are too low and don't allow for enough correct motivation. 2. Severely underestimating what it will take in terms of actions, resources, money, and energy to accomplish the target. 3. Spending too much time competing and not enough time dominating their sector. 4. Underestimating the amount of adversity they will need to overcome in order to actually attain their desired goal.

“Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows.

“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.” —Steve Jobs

Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you’re sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it. Attribution is about putting little museum labels next to the stuff you share.

The real one is scared to death.

Remember, the part of us that we imagine needs healing is not the part we create from; that part is far deeper and stronger. The part we create from can’t be touched by anything our parents did, or society did. That part is unsullied, uncorrupted; soundproof, waterproof, and bulletproof. In fact, the more troubles we’ve got, the better and richer that part becomes.   The part that needs healing is our personal life. Personal life has nothing to do with work. Besides, what better way of healing than to find our center of self-sovereignty? Isn’t that the whole point of healing?

My bitching self is receding now. The instincts are taking over. Another hour passes. I turn the corner of a thicket and there he is: the nice fat hare I knew would show up if I just kept plugging.   Home from the hill, I thank the immortals and offer up their portion of the kill. They brought it to me; they deserve their share. I am grateful.   I joke with my kids beside the fire. They’re happy; the old man has brought home the bacon. The old lady’s happy; she’s cooking it up. I’m happy; I’ve earned my keep on the planet, at least for this day.   Resistance is not a factor now. I don’t think of the hunt and I don’t think of the office. The tension drains from my neck and back. What I feel and say and do this night will not be coming from any disowned or unresolved part of me, any part corrupted by Resistance.   I go to sleep content, but my final thought is of Resistance. I will wake up with it tomorrow. Already I am steeling myself.

WHAT A WRITER’S DAY FEELS LIKE   I wake up with a gnawing sensation of dissatisfaction. Already I feel fear. Already the loved ones around me are starting to fade. I interact. I’m present. But I’m not.   I’m not thinking about the work. I’ve already consigned that to the Muse. What I am aware of is Resistance. I feel it in my guts. I afford it the utmost respect, because I know it can defeat me on any given day as easily as the need for a drink can overcome an alcoholic   I go through the chores, the correspondence, the obligations of daily life. Again I’m there but not really. The clock is running in my head; I know I can indulge in daily crap for a little while, but I must cut it off when the bell rings.   I’m keenly aware of the Principle of Priority, which states (a) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and (b) you must do what’s important first.   What’s important is the work. That’s the game I have to suit up for. That’s the field on which I have to leave everything I’ve got.   Do I really believe that my work is crucial to the planet’s survival? Of course not. But it’s as important to me as catching that mouse is to the hawk circling outside my window. He’s hungry. He needs a kill. So do I.   I’m done with my chores now. It’s time. I say my prayer and head out on the hunt.   The sun isn’t up yet; it’s cold; the fields are sopping. Brambles scratch my ankles, branches snap back in my face. The hill is a sonofabitch but what can you do? Set one foot in front of another and keep climbing.   An hour passes. I’m warmer now, the pace has got my blood going. The years have taught me one skill: how to be miserable. I know how to shut up and keep humping. This is a great asset because it’s human, the proper role for a mortal. It does not offend the gods, but elicits their intercession.

Two things can happen after the climatic event; a reaction (Automatic Rally/Reaction) or a lateral movement. If a reaction appears, it will be followed by a Secondary Test; conversely, if a lateral movement takes place, the market will most likely continue in the direction of the previous trend.
